Social media platforms like Instagram are increasingly targeted by fake accounts and bots that spread spam, misinformation, and scams, which degrade user experience and trust. Detecting these fake accounts manually is nearly impossible due to the vast number of users and the sophisticated tactics used to mimic real behavior. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop automated methods that can analyze user profiles, behaviors, and interactions to accurately identify and filter out fake accounts, helping to create a safer and more authentic online community.
